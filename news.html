<th>Here's everything we know about Microsoft's virtual reality headset HoloLens</th>
<td>Published: <span class="timestamp"> 18/10/2015 05:30</span></br>
HoloLens is a big deal for Microsoft, a company that is struggling to retain relevancy with consumers after it missed out on the smartphone and tablet boom.</br>
Rather than doubling down on mobile, Microsoft has decided to look into the future — and the result is HoloLens.</br>
The headset, which has been at least three years in the making and is rumoured to be released sometime in early 2017, is all part of the new "One Windows" strategy that sees Microsoft unify around the different strands of Windows.</br>

<th>What did the 1980s sci-fi classic get right about the future we now live in?</th>
<td>Published: <span class="timestamp">17/10/2015 04:30</span> </br>Where's my flying car? The skies are meant to be full of them as Wednesday approaches. Where are the hoverboards? Why are we still tying our own shoelaces? 

"Great Scott! There must be a disturbance in the space-time continuum!" If you have no idea what I'm talking about then you are either living in a parallel universe or have somehow escaped all the hype, because Wednesday is Back to the Future Day. This is the date to which Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel in the enormously popular 1980s movie Back To The Future II: 21 October 2015...</br>

<th>Microsoft: 'All virtual reality platforms will converge to mixed reality'</th>

SAN FRANCISCO – Virtual reality is just a stepping stone for augmented reality.</br>
This was a conclusion a group of panelist reached during a breakout session discussion about the future of video games at GamesBeat 2015. Game developers today may still be trying to figure out how best to integrate virtual reality technology to enhance the gaming experience, but ultimately, they should be thinking of where they would like the technology to be and what kind of gaming experiences they could offer. Game developers want to figure out what will transform the gaming landscape in the next 20 years...</br>

<th>NASA Confirms Evidence That Liquid Water Flows on Today's Mars</th>
<td>Published: <span class="timestamp">28/9/2015 12:00</span></br>
<img src="Images/imgMars.jpg" alt="image of water found on mars">
New findings from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) provide the strongest evidence yet that liquid water flows intermittently on present-day Mars. Using an imaging spectrometer on MRO, researchers detected signatures of hydrated minerals on slopes where mysterious streaks are seen on the Red Planet. These darkish streaks appear to ebb and flow over time. They darken and appear to flow down steep slopes during warm seasons, and then fade in cooler seasons. They appear in several locations on Mars when temperatures are above minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 23 Celsius), and disappear at colder times.</br>"Our quest on Mars has been to 'follow the water,' in our search for life in the universe, and now we have convincing science that validates what we've long suspected," said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington...<>
